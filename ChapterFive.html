   ight had fallen on the moors. High in the sky a full moon hung and beams of light shone down, illuminating the lush ground. The air was still and silent. Most of the Moorland creatures were asleep, some tucked in the leaves on the ground, others resting in trees. Through it all, a sleeping Aurora floated. Maleficent walked a few paces behind while Diaval flew ahead. As the trio made their way along, a few curious faeries peeped out, eager to see who would dare disturb the peaceful wood at that hour. Arriving at a small glen through which a shallow stream burbled, Maleficent lowered Aurora gently to the ground. Then she slipped into the shadows. She took a deep breath, then whispered, “Awaken.” </p>
   <p class="block_24">Maleficent waited, her heart pounding. She was beginning to regret her decision to bring the girl there. What had possessed her? It had seemed like a good idea at the time, but now, as Aurora’s eyes fluttered open, Maleficent was beginning to think differently. Slowly, Aurora sat up. She took in her surroundings calmly with her big blue eyes, as though waking up in an unfamiliar grove of trees was a common event for her. Watching Aurora take in the Moors, Maleficent felt an ache in her chest. She had never felt comfortable out of her familiar surroundings. Yet Aurora, who had lived her whole life in one cottage and knew only three people, seemed unfazed. Turning her head in Maleficent’s direction, Aurora spoke.</p>
   <p class="block_24"> “I know you’re there.” Startled, Maleficent slipped farther back into the shadows. “Don’t be afraid,” Aurora added. “I’m not afraid,” Maleficent said defensively. She slapped a hand over her mouth. As soon as the words had slipped out, she wished could take them back. Now there was no hiding.“Then come out,” Aurora pleaded.</p>
   <p class="block_24"> Maleficent smiled. Ah, maybe there was a way out of this after all. “Then you’ll be afraid,” she said. But Aurora shook her head. “No, I won’t,” she said stubbornly.</p>
   <p class="block_24">
   It appeared Maleficent had no choice. She hadn’t really thought through what would happen once Aurora was in the Moors, but she most certainly hadn’t thought she would have to talk to the princess. Nevertheless, if Aurora was like any other human, the girl would run away as soon as she saw Maleficent. Stepping out of the shadows, Maleficent made her way closer. A bright beam of moonlight shot down, illuminating her, and she cast a long shadow on the ground behind her. In the night, her horns looked bigger and darker, and she was not surprised to see Aurora’s eyes widen with fear. But what did surprise her was that Aurora didn’t run. Instead, she spoke.</p>
   <p class="block_24"> “I know who you are,” she said, causing Maleficent to raise an eyebrow. “You’re my faerie godmother.” A chuckle caught in Maleficent’s throat. “Your…what?” she asked, trying not to laugh out loud. Ignoring Maleficent’s reaction, Aurora nodded. “Faerie godmother,” she repeated slowly. “You’ve been watching over me my whole life. I’ve always known you were close by.” “How?” Maleficent asked, curiosity getting the best of her.</p>
   <p class="block_24">
   Aurora pointed over Maleficent’s shoulder. Turning, Maleficent saw her distinct horned shadow. “It’s been following me ever since I was small,” Aurora explained. “Wherever I went, your shadow was always with me.” Hearing that, Diaval let out a loud caw. While Maleficent knew he was, in his own bird way, saying something along the lines of “I knew it!” Aurora simply heard the birdcall and smiled. Watching as Diaval landed on Maleficent’s shoulder, she paused and then made her way closer.</p>
   <p class="block_24"> “I remember you!” she said, reaching up to pet Diaval. “Pretty bird.” Maleficent tried not to cringe as the girl’s small hand brushed her shoulder. She hadn’t been this close to a stranger in a long, long time. To her surprise, it didn’t feel as terrible as she would have thought. And what was even more surprising was how at home Aurora seemed in the glen. She turned from Diaval and wandered around, bending down every now and then to get a closer look at the small flowers and plants that were different from the ones on her side of the Wall.</p>
   <p class="block_24"> As she explored, Moorland faeries, awoken from their slumber, began to emerge, curious to see the human in their midst. When Aurora caught sight of the winged creatures, her face filled with wonder. Maleficent felt herself smiling as several courageous dew faeries fluttered up to the princess, their translucent wings glimmering in the moonlight.</p> 
   <p class="block_24">It had been a long time since Maleficent had really looked at her home. True, she fought to defend it and loved it fiercely, but with Aurora there, she was seeing it in a fresh light. It was beautiful and mysterious. Peaceful and yet alive. The trees protected the plants, and the plants hugged the ground. There was a home and place for everyone and everything. That, Maleficent thought, was why she fought so hard to keep it safe. Unaware of Maleficent’s musings, Aurora softly ran her hand over the top of a cattail.
   “I’ve always wanted to come here,” she said softly. “But my aunts told me it was forbidden.” She looked up, and her eyes met Maleficent’s. “How did we get through the Wall?” The question snapped Maleficent back to reality. It was one thing to have the girl there for a short while, but it would not do to have her asking questions and wanting to come back.</p>
   <p class="block_24"> “It’s time to take you home,” Maleficent said, not answering Aurora. “So soon?” the princess said, clearly disappointed. “May I come back another night?” Instead of answering, Maleficent reached into her robe and pulled out another yellow flower. Once again, she blew on it, sending pollen into the air in front of Aurora. And once again, Aurora’s eyes fluttered shut and her body went limp. 
   As the other faeries looked on, Maleficent raised Aurora into the air. And then, in silence, they left the glen. A short while later they arrived at the small cottage. Quietly, Maleficent floated Aurora into her room and gently lowered her onto her bed. Leaning over the princess, Maleficent felt a small smile tug at the corners of her lips.</p>
   <p class="block_24"> “Good night, beastie,” she said gently before turning to go. At the door, she paused to take one last look at Aurora. It hadn’t been so bad after all to have her around the glen. But it was a onetime thing. It could never happen again. Ever.</p><br/></div>
