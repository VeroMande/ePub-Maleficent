    he Moors were abuzz with excitement. The wallerbogs burbled and gurgled more mud.The dew faeries flew from leaf to leaf, leaving sparkling water shining like diamonds in their wake. In the streams, the water faeries preened more than usual. The rest of the Fair Folk headed straight for the Faerie Mound. Today was the big day, and they did not want to miss anything.</p>
	<p class="block_24">Maleficent stood in front of the throne on the Mound, smiling at the familiar faces around her. Diaval stood at her side. Nearby, Sweetpea winked at her, and Robin positively beamed. Maleficent felt so grateful they were all there.</p>
	<p class="block_24"> Her family.A rustle in the brush alerted them that their guest of honor had arrived. Maleficent turned her head to see Aurora striding toward the Mound, a halo of sunlit hair glowing around her face. The flowers bloomed excitedly as Aurora passed them, and the hovering sparrows chirped happily. She stopped in front of Maleficent, grinning at her faerie godmother. Maleficent’s eyes welled with proud tears.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“Oh, there she is! Hurry up! They’re waiting!” Knotgrass’s shrill voice came from the other side of the Mound. The crowd turned to see Knotgrass and Flittle zigzagging toward them with a gleaming crown in tow.“Wait for me!” Thistlewit called, trailing behind them.</p>
	<p class="block_24">As soon as the three pixies reached Maleficent and Aurora, they paused midair, gasping dramatically to catch their breath. Maleficent restrained herself from rolling her eyes. Finally, Knotgrass spoke.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“We present this crown to our little Aurora, for whom we have sacrificed the best years of our—” She coughed, stopping her speech as soon as she saw the glare Maleficent was giving her.Maleficent knew it was time to take matters in her own hands. <i>Never send a pixie to do a faerie godmother’s job</i>, she thought, taking the crown from Knotgrass. Then, ever so gently, she placed it upon Aurora’s head.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“You have your queen,” Maleficent announced to the crowd. A joyous cheer erupted. Maleficent watched Aurora smile warmly, a smile that only grew as she saw Phillip approach the throne.</p>
	<p class="block_24"> Maleficent watched as Aurora greeted the border guards, shaking their wooden hands, officially forming a new allegiance.It was all Maleficent’s parents had wanted—peace and harmony. The scene overwhelmed Maleficent.Aurora would make a great and noble queen.</p>
	<p class="block_24"> One to unite the lands and bring the humans and Fair Folk together.</p>
	<p class="block_24">But, as many thought whenever they saw the graceful figure soaring through the air, it took a great hero and a terriblle villain to make it all come about. And her name was Maleficent.</p><br/></div>
