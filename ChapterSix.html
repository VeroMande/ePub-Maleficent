    fter tucking Aurora safely into her bed, Maleficent spent the remainder of the night wandering restlessly through the woods near the cottage.The next day was important for so many reasons. In only three days’ time, Aurora would be sixteen. And before that day arrived, she needed to come to the Moors. While Maleficent trusted Aurora to stay strong and stand up to her “aunts,” she wanted to be nearby in case. And with Aurora’s sixteenth birthday fast approaching, she felt an even greater sense of urgency. Aurora needed to be in the Moors—and safe from spinning wheels— immediately.</p>
	<p class="block_24">As the sun rose, Diaval joined Maleficent and the two made their way to the clearing. From the safety of the trees, they watched as life began to stir in the cottage. They heard the clink of pans being put on the stove and the sizzle as eggs were cooked. That was followed by the sounds of dishes being cleaned and the squabbling of the three pixies over who had left the dishes overnight. Maleficent smiled. It would be good for Aurora to get away from those three, even if they did have to visit occasionally.</p>
	<p class="block_24">Finally, Aurora appeared at the cottage door. Looking up at the cloudless blue sky, she smiled and, after saying a quick good-bye to her aunts, began to walk into the woods as she was wont to do every morning. But that morning was different. Because on that morning, not only was she being followed by Maleficent and Diaval, she was gathering up the courage to tell her aunts the news.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“Aunties,” Maleficent heard her say as the girl walked along. “I’m almost sixteen and I need a life of my own.” Maleficent smiled as she listened to Aurora practice her speech. “I love you very much but it’s time—”</p>
	<p class="block_24">Her voice cut off abruptly as she heard a noise in the bushes. Looking about, she saw a wide tree and ducked behind it. Maleficent had heard the noise, too, and turned her head toward the nearby bushes. A moment later, she watched as a handsome young man stepped out, leading a large white horse. He pushed a strand of thick brown hair out of his brown eyes and looked around.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“Is someone there?” the young man called out.</p>
	<p class="block_24">From her hiding spot, Aurora peeked out. Seeing the man, she quickly ducked back, her cheeks turning red.</p>
	<p class="block_24">Seeing Aurora’s reaction, Maleficent was filled with an ominous feeling. The princess had never seen a man up close before, let alone one this handsome. And there was no denying it: the young man was very, very handsome. He had a regal way of carrying himself and broad shoulders that tapered into a narrow waist, and from what she could see of them, his eyes looked kind. What would happen if he and Aurora spoke? Would he enchant her the way Stefan had enchanted Maleficent all those years before? Would she still want to live in the Moors? Or would she betray the faerie world like her father before her?</p>
	<p class="block_24">As those thoughts raced through Maleficent’s mind, the young man took another step closer. “Hello,” he called out toward where Aurora hid.</p>
	<p class="block_24">Cautiously, Aurora stepped out. “Sorry to bother you,” he said. “But I’m on my way to King Stefan’s castle and I’ve become hopelessly lost. Can you help me?” As he spoke, he took another step forward.</p>
	<p class="block_24">Nervous, Aurora stepped back, stumbling over a rock and falling to the ground with a thump.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“I’m sorry,” the young man said. “That was my doing. I rushed in too fast and frightened you. Forgive me?” He held out his hand to help her up.</p>
	<p class="block_24">Just as he pulled her to her feet, a ray of sun shot down, turning Aurora’s golden hair still more golden and illuminating her tall, lean body and beautiful face. Maleficent watched as the young man’s eyes grew wide. He was entranced. She saw his breath quicken and his face flush. She also saw that Aurora’s hand nervously went to her throat, as though she was unsure of herself in front of the man.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“It’s that way,” she finally said, her voice breathless.</p>
	<p class="block_24">The young man nodded but didn’t answer.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“The castle,” Aurora added, worried that he didn’t know what she was talking about.</p>
	<p class="block_24">He nodded again.</p>
	<p class="block_24">Watching, Maleficent didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. The young man was clearly love struck. And Aurora? Well, she was growing bolder, less shy, with each passing moment. If it weren’t so upsetting, Maleficent would be proud of her brave Aurora. But selfishly, she wanted the girl to stay quiet.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“What’s your name?” Aurora asked, trying to get him to speak.</p>
	<p class="block_24">The young man once again didn’t say anything. Not for a moment. He just stood there, transfixed and seemingly unable to think of his own name. Finally, he shook his head and blinked, as if coming to from a long sleep. “Phillip,” he said. “It’s Phillip.”</p>
	<p class="block_24">Aurora smiled. “Hello, Phillip.”</p>
	<p class="block_24">“What’s yours?” Phillip asked, mesmerized.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“Aurora.”</p>
	<p class="block_24">“Hello, Aurora,” he said softly.</p>
	<p class="block_24">As around them the birds chirped and the wind blew gently, the pair stood there, gazing into each other’s eyes. For them, it was as though time were standing still. For Maleficent, it was as though time were speeding up. She could clearly see what was to happen. This Phillip would woo her Aurora. Take her away and never be able to protect her from the curse. And Aurora would go, unaware of the danger she faced. With a sigh, Maleficent waited to see if she was right.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“Well, thank you for your help,” Phillip said, finally breaking the silence. “I’d best be off, then.” He whistled loudly and his white horse trotted over. Phillip pulled himself into the saddle and reluctantly turned to go.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“Will you be back?” Aurora called out.</p>
	<p class="block_24">Smiling, Phillip looked over his shoulder. “Nothing could stop me.”</p>
	<p class="block_24">Letting out a happy laugh, Aurora said, “Then I’ll see you soon. Good-bye, Phillip.” She waved as he rode off, looking back over his shoulder as if to make sure she was still there.</p><br/>

	<p class="block_24">Long after Phillip had disappeared over the horizon, Aurora stood there, until, humming a happy little tune, she left the glen. In the woods nearby, Maleficent fretted. Diaval, who had been sitting on her shoulder the whole time, began to pick incessantly at her with his beak. Reaching up, she grabbed his bird feet. “Stop doing that!” she hissed. When he began to squirm, Maleficent waved a hand, transforming him into his human form.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“That boy is the answer!” Diaval said the instant he could speak.</p>
	<p class="block_24">Maleficent shook her head. “No, Diaval,” she said sadly.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“Yes!” he countered. “True Love’s Kiss, remember? It will break the spell!”</p>
	<p class="block_24">“True Love’s Kiss?” Maleficent repeated. Was he serious? Did he really not get it? This was why she had wanted to keep Aurora in the Moors in the first place. Because there were fools who might actually believe there was a way to stop the inevitable. But there wasn’t.</p>
	<p class="block_24">There could never be. She knew the truth all too well, as she had lived it herself. Filled with renewed bitterness, she went on. “Have you not worked it out yet? I cursed her that way because there is no such thing.”</p>
	<p class="block_24">Diaval didn’t say anything for a moment. Then, softly, he said, “That may be the way <i>you </i>feel. But what about Aurora? That boy could be her only chance. It’s <i>her </i>fate, not yours! Haven’t you done enough?”</p>
	<p class="block_24">The words cut deep. What Diaval said was true. She had already done enough, too much. She had put Aurora in this position, yet…it made her furious that Diaval had to point it out. He knew nothing! What right did he have to make her feel worse than she already did? Her temper flaring, she lifted her hand, ready to transform him. But Diaval spoke, surprising her.</p>
	<p class="block_24">“Go ahead!” he cried. “Turn me into whatever you want. A bird, a worm. I don’t care anymore.” Not waiting to see what she would do, Diaval turned and walked away.</p>
	<p class="block_24">Behind him, Maleficent watched him go, her emotions churning. She hated him for talking to her like that. Hated him for making her feel guilty. Yet if she hated him so much, why was she so upset to see him go? Maleficent sighed. Why had everything gotten so complicated?</p>
